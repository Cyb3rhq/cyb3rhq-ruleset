  - id: 6504 
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."

    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy.
